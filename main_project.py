st.write("""
We began by importing and cleaning the **Netflix dataset** (`updated_netflix.csv`).  
This included:
- Handling missing values
- Splitting duration into numerical + type (e.g., '90 min', '1 Season')
- Converting string dates into datetime objects
- Creating derived columns for analysis like: `release_year`, `month_added`, `day_of_week`, etc.

Once cleaned, the dataset was imported into **MySQL** for SQL-based querying and analysis.

- **Explanation:**
  - Highlights frequent collaborations (where director names are available).
  - Suggests active contributors with high volume, useful for trend or quality analysis.
  - However, many entries have **missing or 'Unknown' directors**, likely due to incomplete metadata.

- **Conclusion:** While some well-known directors appear in the top list, a large portion of content is tagged with unknown or missing director names.  
  Dropping the `director` column would lead to loss of meaningful insights where data **is** present â€” so we kept it, used filters, and extracted value where possible.
